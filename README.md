##  Completed Tasks

### **Task 1 – Iris Dataset Exploration**
**Key Work Done:**
- Loaded and inspected the Iris dataset using pandas and seaborn  
- Performed descriptive analysis using `.info()` and `.describe()`  
- Visualized the dataset using scatter plots, pairplots, histograms, and boxplots  
- Explored feature relationships and species distributions  

**Notebook:** `Task1_Iris_Visualization.ipynb`

### **Task 3 – Heart Disease Prediction**
**Key Work Done:**
- Cleaned dataset and filled missing values  
- Conducted EDA including correlations and distribution analysis  
- Trained Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models  
- Evaluated results using accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and ROC-AUC score  
- Identified important features impacting predictions

### **Task 6 – House Price Prediction**
**Key Work Done:**
- Loaded dataset using KaggleHub  
- Performed preprocessing with one hot encoding, scaling, and handling skewed targets  
- Trained Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models  
- Applied GridSearchCV for Gradient Boosting tuning  
- Evaluated models using MAE, RMSE, and R²  
- Plotted actual vs predicted values  
- Exported best model as `gbr_model.joblib`
